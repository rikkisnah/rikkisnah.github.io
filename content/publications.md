## 2006: Race Counts Against New Citizen When Renting House

**Published:** August 23, 2006
**Platform:** Straits Times Forum
**Topic:** Racial Discrimination in Singapore

### Summary

A personal account of experiencing racial discrimination in Singapore's housing market despite being a citizen with a good job. The article sparked broader discussion about the need for anti-discrimination laws in employment and housing.

### Key Points

**The Experience:**
- As a new Singaporean citizen of Mauritian-Indian origin, I faced systematic racial discrimination while searching for rental housing
- Multiple landlords explicitly refused to rent to Indians
- When my French wife's name was used instead, landlords immediately agreed
- Real estate agents revealed landlords' explicit preferences: Ang mohs > Chinese > Malays > Indians

**The Core Issue:**

> "WHEN I listened to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's speech, I was happy to hear about welcoming talents, upholding the multicultural society and meritocracy, irrespective of race... But this experience made me wonder: Has the Government done enough to educate the people on the real meaning of multiculturalism? Should there not be a law to stop such discrimination?"

**Main Arguments:**

1. **Policy vs. Practice Gap** - Singapore welcomes foreign talent but residents practice racial discrimination
2. **Legal Gap** - No law prohibits racial discrimination in housing or employment
3. **Institutional Void** - No Equal Opportunity Commission, no Ombudsman, no Human Rights Commission
4. **Personal Irony** - As a beneficiary of Singapore's Foreign Talent Programme, I contributed to the economy but was still discriminated against

### Background

I came to Singapore in 1997 under the Foreign Talent Programme to study at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The government provided:
- Financial support throughout my three-year degree
- Post-graduation permanent residence offer
- Job placement assistance through the Economic Development Board's Training Attachment Programme (post-9/11)

Two years after graduation, I took up citizenshipâ€”a meaningful commitment despite being alone in the country. When I married and sought to rent an apartment, this discrimination became personal.

### Impact & Response

The article was featured in Think Centre Singapore, a civil society organization focused on promoting multicultural understanding. It sparked a broader conversation about:
- Racial discrimination in Singapore's supposedly meritocratic society
- The absence of legal protections for minorities
- The need for an Equal Opportunity Commission

**Think Centre's Response:**

> "Think Centre agrees that racial discrimination is normal in Singapore... There is no law against racial discrimination in employment. There is no equal opportunity commission, no ombudsman, and no human rights commission where one could log their complaints. Think Centre hopes someday such an Equal Opportunity Commission, like in Hong Kong, will be set-up in Singapore."

### Reflection

This experience crystallized my belief that:
- **Data Matters** - Statistics and personal accounts make discrimination undeniable
- **Systems Change Requires Law** - Voluntary goodwill is insufficient
- **Belonging is Conditional** - Even citizenship and economic contribution don't guarantee acceptance
- **Speaking Up Matters** - Public discourse can drive policy change
