## The Security Dream

By November 2000, Java's security sandbox had become the most important—and most frustrating—aspect of applet development. Sun Microsystems had made bold promises: Java applets would be safe to run from any source. The sandboxing mechanism would prevent malicious code from accessing your files, your network, or your system.

The idea was revolutionary. For the first time, you could download and run code from unknown sources with reasonable confidence that it wouldn't destroy your computer. This was genuinely innovative.

## The Reality of Locked-Down Applets

Yet this same security that promised to keep us safe also made applets nearly useless for any serious work. I spent weeks theorizing solutions to security problems:

- Applets couldn't read local files. How do you build a document editor in an applet?
- Applets couldn't make arbitrary network connections. How do you build a messaging application?
- Applets couldn't access the clipboard. How do you copy data in and out?

Every capability we needed, security restrictions prevented. Security had won, but utility had lost.

## The Early Mobile Promise

Early mobile devices were starting to get Java support. The idea was intoxicating: write code once in Java, run it on phones, on desktop applets, on servers. The "write once, run anywhere" dream extended to mobile.

But mobile devices had security considerations too. How do you give applications access to make phone calls or send messages without risking abuse?

## Supply Chain Constraints

Interestingly, the biggest constraint wasn't technical—it was supply. Not supply of Java expertise (there was plenty of that), but supply of compatible devices and environments. Java was trying to run everywhere, but there wasn't universal adoption. Different manufacturers, different versions, different capability levels.

## Security Lessons

- **Prioritize security**: I learned this lesson deeply—security can't be an afterthought. But equally important: security needs to be balanced against functionality. A system so secure it's useless serves no one.
- **Assume nothing**: Don't assume users have the latest JVM. Don't assume they've granted appropriate permissions. Build for worst-case security.
- **Trust boundaries matter**: Understanding what code runs where, and what data crosses which boundaries—this became central to how I think about systems.

## A Turning Point

Looking back, November 2000 represented a turning point. The limitations of applets were becoming undeniable. The security sandbox was too restrictive. Alternative approaches—server-side Java with HTML front-ends, Java on mobile, or entirely different languages—were starting to look more promising.

The applet era was entering its twilight. But the security lessons were just beginning.
