## Moving to Motorola

In 2002, I left academia and joined Motorola Mobile Devices. The timing was perfect. Motorola was at the center of the 3G revolution—the transition from 2G networks (which enabled SMS and basic data) to 3G networks (which promised high-speed data and multimedia).

## The 3G Vision

The promise was intoxicating. Imagine a mobile phone that could stream video, enable real-time applications, support navigation and location services. 3G would deliver megabits per second instead of kilobits. This wasn't just an incremental upgrade; it was a paradigm shift.

At Motorola, I spent weeks prototyping solutions—everything from protocol handlers to application frameworks that could take advantage of 3G speeds. The handsets we were building were getting more powerful, more capable, more connected.

## The Challenge of Evolution

Early mobile phones had strict power, size, and cost constraints. Adding 3G capability meant more powerful processors, better antennas, more sophisticated power management. Every hardware change rippled through software.

Latency spikes were an early problem. When transitioning between 2G and 3G networks, connection handoffs could create visible delays. We developed techniques to smooth these transitions, to make the experience seamless for users.

## Industry Evolution

Around this time, Motorola was still riding high—but Nokia was challenging our market position. The competitive pressure drove innovation. Every feature Nokia added, Motorola needed to match or exceed. It was exhausting and exhilarating.

## Lessons from Factory Life

Working on the "factory floor" (as a prototype developer) taught me different lessons than academic life:

- **Iterate fast**: In a competitive market, you can't afford lengthy development cycles. Release, learn, iterate. Speed was a feature.
- **Document everything**: When hardware is expensive and manufacturing cycles are long, every design decision matters. Documentation had to be precise, clear, and complete.
- **Build for constraints**: Unlike servers with unlimited power, mobile devices ran on batteries. Efficiency wasn't optional; it was essential.

## The User Impact

The 3G phones we prototyped in 2002 weren't the final products, but they pointed toward the future. By 2005, 3G phones would be mainstream. By 2010, users would expect this functionality as baseline.

Looking back, those "thrills" of the 3G rollout were seeing into the future—imagining how mobile communication would reshape society, and working to make that future real.

The 3G revolution, launched in 2002, would reshape the entire landscape of technology and human connection.
