## Wireless Revolution Begins

By July 1999, Wi-Fi technology was emerging from IEEE 802.11 specifications into practical reality. Singapore, as a forward-thinking tech hub, was one of the first places to experiment with widespread wireless networking. As an NTU student, I had access to some of these early deployments, and the possibilities seemed limitless.

## The Technical Frontier

I spent weeks debugging solutions for wireless connectivity. The early Wi-Fi standards had significant challenges. Signal attenuation was unpredictable. Interference from other devices caused packet loss. Range was limited—often just a few meters reliably. Yet the promise was extraordinary: computers could communicate without wires.

The humidity of Singapore added another layer of complexity. Moisture affects radio propagation in ways we didn't fully understand. Our experimental setups in the NTU labs sometimes worked perfectly, sometimes failed mysteriously. Debugging wireless issues felt more like art than science.

## Supply Chain Constraints

One of the biggest challenges was supply. Wi-Fi equipment was rare, expensive, and difficult to source. We worked with what we had, often repurposing equipment or building custom adapters. Supply crunches were real, and they forced us to be creative and resourceful.

## Early Mobile Connections

Around the same time, early mobile devices were beginning to support data. The idea of combining mobile phones with Wi-Fi seemed radical—what would you even use it for? But we were experimenting, testing, imagining the future.

## Lessons for Building Connected Systems

Through these experiments, I learned:

- **Embrace modularity**: Wireless networks are inherently modular. Each access point is independent. This modular thinking became central to how I design systems.
- **Test ruthlessly**: Wireless systems are non-deterministic. You can't test once and be confident. Continuous testing, in various conditions, is essential.
- **Prioritize security**: From the very beginning, we realized that wireless communication presents security challenges. Data travels through the air, visible to anyone with a receiver. Security can't be an afterthought.

## The Vision

Tying back to my roots—from NTU code jams to OCI racks—this era shaped how I see tech: not as gadgets, but as bridges to possibility. Wi-Fi didn't just connect computers; it connected people.

Looking ahead, wireless technology would become the foundation of modern connectivity. We didn't know it then, but we were building the infrastructure of the 21st century.
