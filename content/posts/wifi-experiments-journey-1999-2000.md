## Wireless Networking (1999)

IEEE 802.11 shipped in 1997. By 1999, Singapore was ahead of the curve—early 802.11b trials at universities. At NTU, we had access to experimental wireless infrastructure. The dream: no wires. Just laptops talking over the air.

Reality: signal was weak, interference constant, range 20 meters on a good day. Tropical humidity killed performance. Water vapor absorbs radio waves. Our tests worked in the lab, then failed in the hallway.

But the core promise was undeniable: **wireless beats wires**, if you can make the technology reliable.

### Early Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was supply. Wi-Fi equipment was rare, expensive, and difficult to source. We worked with what we had, often repurposing equipment or building custom adapters. Supply crunches were real, and they forced us to be creative and resourceful.

Around the same time, early mobile devices were beginning to support data. The idea of combining mobile phones with Wi-Fi seemed radical—what would you even use it for? But we were experimenting, testing, imagining the future.

## From Lab Success to Campus Networks (May 2000)

By May 2000, our Wi-Fi experiments from 1999 had proven successful enough that NTU was considering a campus-wide deployment. This wasn't just about adding more access points; it was about understanding how wireless networks could scale from experimental hobby to critical infrastructure.

The challenge shifted from "can we do this?" to "how do we do this reliably for hundreds of users simultaneously?"

### Scaling Wireless Networks

I spent weeks scaling solutions, grappling with the complexities of managing a distributed network of access points. Signal overlap, roaming handoffs, interference patterns—these weren't just theoretical problems anymore. They were affecting real users trying to access university resources wirelessly.

The early lessons from 1999 needed to be formalized. What worked in controlled lab conditions needed to work in chaotic real-world conditions: crowded hallways, metal-heavy buildings, competing radio frequencies.

### AI Ethics and Tech Responsibility

Around this time, conversations about "AI ethics" were beginning to emerge in academic circles. While AI was still largely theoretical, we started thinking about the ethical implications of our technologies. Wireless networks that tracked user locations, data security in an open environment, privacy concerns—these were early versions of problems that would become increasingly pressing.

We designed our systems with these principles in mind: minimize data collection, maximize user control, prioritize privacy.

## Core Principles That Emerged

Through both the experimental and scaling phases, clear principles emerged:

- **Embrace modularity**: Wireless networks are inherently modular. Each access point is independent. A campus-wide Wi-Fi network is inherently modular—each building, each floor, each room could have independent access points. Modularity wasn't just nice to have; it was essential.
- **Test ruthlessly**: Wireless systems are non-deterministic. You can't test once and be confident. Continuous testing in various conditions is essential. We couldn't just make one powerful access point; we needed a distributed approach.
- **Prioritize security**: From the very beginning, we realized that wireless communication presents security challenges. Data travels through the air, visible to anyone with a receiver. We implemented early encryption and access control mechanisms. Security can't be an afterthought.
- **Scale horizontally**: We couldn't just make one powerful access point. We needed a distributed approach—multiple access points coordinating to create seamless coverage.

## The Breakthrough

When users could roam seamlessly across campus, moving from one building to another without losing their connection, it was transformative. Students could start work in the library, move to a cafe, continue in the dorms—all while maintaining connectivity.

This wasn't just convenience. It was a fundamental shift in how computing worked. The computer was becoming untethered from location.

## Looking Forward

The "spotty networks" of 2000 would eventually become the ubiquitous connectivity we take for granted today. Wireless technology would become the foundation of modern connectivity. We didn't know it then, but we were building the infrastructure of the 21st century.
