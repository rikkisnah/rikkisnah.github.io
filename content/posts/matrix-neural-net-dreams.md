## The Dream of Artificial Intelligence

In May 1999, while the world was preoccupied with the approaching Y2K crisis, I found myself exploring something entirely different in the NTU labs: neural networks. The term "neural net dreams" might sound whimsical now, but in 1999, this was genuinely visionary work. We were exploring how computers could learn from data, much like the human brain.

## The Technical Challenge

Matrix operations are the backbone of neural networks. Every forward pass through a network involves complex matrix multiplications. I spent weeks debugging solutions—understanding backpropagation, working through the mathematics of gradient descent, trying to make these networks actually learn from data.

The challenge was overwhelming. Data floods were constant. We had limited computational resources, yet we were trying to train networks on datasets that pushed our machines to their limits. Every iteration took hours. Patience became a virtue; failure was frequent.

## The 5G Dreams

Around this time, visionaries were already talking about 5G networks—though it would be decades before they arrived. The theoretical bandwidth and latency improvements excited us. We imagined: what if networks could transfer model weights instantly? What if we could distribute neural network training across multiple machines with minimal communication overhead?

## Breakthrough Moments

But when the network actually learned—when it showed an ability to generalize from training data to unseen test data—it was pure magic. The theory was validated. The mathematics worked. These early experiments felt like touching the future.

## Core Lessons

- **Test ruthlessly**: Neural networks have thousands of hyperparameters. Testing every combination is impractical, but systematic testing of the most critical ones is essential.
- **Scale horizontally**: One machine couldn't handle the computational load. We began thinking about distributed learning early.
- **Document everything**: The mathematics of neural networks is complex. Every experiment needs clear documentation of approach, hyperparameters, and results.

Looking back, these "dreams" in May 1999 were actually early explorations of what would become modern deep learning. We were perhaps a decade early, but the foundations were being laid.
