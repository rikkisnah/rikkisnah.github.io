<h3> Happy 15th Birthday, Rekha Laxmi Clara Kisnah </h3>

> Fifteen suns have risen for you, Rekha—  
> The princess who turned a house into a kingdom.  
> A learner, a dreamer, a spark that won't dim,  
> You now stand at the edge of new roads—  
> Eligible to drive, but already steering hearts.  

> Your Dada once dreamt you'd be a lawyer,  
> And Chouma (Doris) at Harvard would employ her—  
> Books in hand, wisdom in your eyes.  
> Your dad was the first to kiss your forehead,  
> A secret your mom pretends not to know.  

> When you're sad, clouds gather and rain;  
> When you smile, the whole sky clears.  
> You drive your brother wild, your parents too—  
> But they'd never trade a second of you.  

> Stay bold, stay kind, stay you, Rekha.  
> The world will know your name.  
> Happy birthday, center of our galaxy.
