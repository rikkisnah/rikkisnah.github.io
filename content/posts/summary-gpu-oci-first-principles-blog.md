## The Journey: From Vision to Zettascale Reality

### Phase 1: Laying the Foundation (2022–2023)
In December 2022, Jag Brar articulated OCI's vision for a revolutionary high-performance network built around RDMA, eliminating CPU and kernel bottlenecks to enable direct GPU-to-GPU communication. This wasn't just theory—by February 2023, OCI deployed its first production GPU supercluster, proving that architecture grounded in physics and systems design could scale massively. This marked OCI's ascent into the upper echelon of AI infrastructure providers.

### Phase 2: Refining for Real-World Impact (2023–2024)
Throughout 2023, OCI systematically optimized RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) and NVIDIA ConnectX technologies, achieving sub-3 microsecond latencies and dramatically higher throughput. By May 2024, these designs evolved into production-grade, Kubernetes-orchestrated clusters—delivering elastic GPU supercomputing to enterprise customers training large language models (LLMs) and running complex AI workloads. This phase transformed bleeding-edge performance into reliable, repeatable systems.

### Phase 3: Zettascale Reality (2024)
In March 2024, OCI achieved a watershed moment: zettascale computing. With over 131,000 GPUs running in production superclusters powered by the revolutionary multi-planar Acceleron architecture, OCI delivered unprecedented redundancy, deterministic performance, and built-in zero-trust security. Supported by gigawatt-scale data centers with advanced liquid cooling, these systems didn't just scale incrementally—they redefined the boundaries of AI infrastructure.

|------------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Max GPU Cluster** | 800,000 GPUs | 20,000 GPUs | 30,000 GPUs | 15,000 GPUs | 25-53x larger |
| **RDMA Latency** | 2.5 µs | ≥10 µs | ≥15 µs | ≥20 µs | 4-8x faster |
| **Network Architecture** | Multi-planar | Single-plane | Hybrid | Single-plane | Full redundancy |
| **Bare-Metal Access** | Full | Limited | Limited | None | Complete control |
| **Power Infrastructure** | Gigawatt | Megawatt | Megawatt | Megawatt | 100-1000x scale |
| **Bandwidth per GPU** | 3,200 Gb/s | 800 Gb/s | 400 Gb/s | 100 Gb/s | 4-32x higher |

These aren't marginal improvements—they represent fundamental architectural advantages that compound at scale. When training frontier AI models, these differences translate into weeks versus months of training time and millions of dollars in compute costs.
