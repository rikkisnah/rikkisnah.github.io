## From Lab Success to Production

By May 2000, our Wi-Fi experiments from 1999 had proven successful enough that NTU was considering a campus-wide deployment. This wasn't just about adding more access points; it was about understanding how wireless networks could scale from experimental hobby to critical infrastructure.

The challenge shifted from "can we do this?" to "how do we do this reliably for hundreds of users simultaneously?"

## Scaling Wireless Networks

I spent weeks scaling solutions, grappling with the complexities of managing a distributed network of access points. Signal overlap, roaming handoffs, interference patterns—these weren't just theoretical problems anymore. They were affecting real users trying to access university resources wirelessly.

## AI Ethics and Tech Responsibility

Around this time, conversations about "AI ethics" were beginning to emerge in academic circles. While AI was still largely theoretical, we started thinking about the ethical implications of our technologies. Wireless networks that tracked user locations, data security in an open environment, privacy concerns—these were early versions of problems that would become increasingly pressing.

We designed our systems with these principles in mind: minimize data collection, maximize user control, prioritize privacy.

## The Practical Lessons

- **Embrace modularity**: A campus-wide Wi-Fi network is inherently modular. Each building, each floor, each room could have independent access points. Modularity wasn't just nice to have; it was essential.
- **Prioritize security**: With wireless signals traveling through the air, accessible to anyone with a receiver, security was paramount. We implemented early encryption and access control mechanisms.
- **Scale horizontally**: We couldn't just make one powerful access point. We needed a distributed approach—multiple access points coordinating to create seamless coverage.

## The Breakthrough

When users could roam seamlessly across campus, moving from one building to another without losing their connection, it was transformative. Students could start work in the library, move to a cafe, continue in the dorms—all while maintaining connectivity.

This wasn't just convenience. It was a fundamental shift in how computing worked. The computer was becoming untethered from location.

## Looking Forward

Tying back to my roots—from NTU code jams to OCI racks—this era shaped how I see tech: not as gadgets, but as bridges to possibility. Wi-Fi made computing mobile. It connected people, not just devices.

The "spotty networks" of 2000 would eventually become the ubiquitous connectivity we take for granted in 2025.
