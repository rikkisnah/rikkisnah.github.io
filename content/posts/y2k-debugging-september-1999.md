## 94 Days to Midnight

September 28, 1999. Just 94 days until January 1, 2000. The reality of Y2K was no longer abstract—it was imminent. In the NTU labs, we had shifted from "let's fix this" to "we must fix this NOW." The atmosphere was urgent but focused.

## The Final Push

By September, we were debugging solutions at a frantic pace. Every day brought discoveries of systems we hadn't yet examined. Banks were reaching out. Government agencies were escalating. Companies worldwide were panicking, and our solutions were part of the answer.

Latency spikes became a constant concern. When you're adding validation logic to millions of transactions, system performance degrades. Every millisecond mattered. A one-second delay per transaction meant millions of dollars in lost throughput. We optimized obsessively.

## The Spectre of Cloud Bursts

Imagine if all systems tried to process the date change simultaneously. The "cloud burst" of activity on January 1st could overwhelm infrastructure. We designed systems to handle this gracefully—queuing, load balancing, overflow management. It was distributed systems thinking before we had modern cloud infrastructure.

## Running Out of Time

I spent these final months living and breathing Y2K. Sleep was a luxury. Teh tarik runs became more frequent. The humidity seemed more oppressive. Every bug fixed revealed five more to fix. Every test uncovered edge cases we hadn't considered.

## Lessons in High-Pressure Delivery

- **Document everything**: In crisis mode, it's tempting to skip documentation. But we needed to communicate our fixes to deployment teams. Clear documentation was the only way to achieve this.
- **Iterate fast**: We couldn't afford lengthy approval processes. We needed to identify issues, fix them, test them, and deploy them quickly. Speed without recklessness.
- **Communicate constantly**: As the deadline approached, stakeholder anxiety grew. Regular updates—even when we had to report bad news—kept everyone informed and aligned.

## The Eye of the Storm

As September ended and October began, we had fixed the critical issues, but uncertainty remained. Would everything work when the clock struck midnight? Or would the systems we'd worked on so intensively fail spectacularly?

The answer would come in exactly 64 days.
