## The OS Wars Intensify

By January 2003, it was clear that mobile phones were becoming mini-computers. The question was: what operating system would power them? Windows Mobile existed but was bloated. Linux was open source but immature on mobile. And there was Symbian—an elegant operating system designed specifically for mobile devices from the ground up.

Motorola was exploring Symbian. At the factory floor, I spent weeks scaling Symbian solutions—trying to understand how to build robust, feature-rich applications on this novel platform.

## The Challenge of Embedded Development

Symbian was genuinely different from development on PCs or servers. Memory was scarce. Power was precious. The development tools were not mature. Documentation was inconsistent. Learning Symbian meant learning a completely different way of thinking about systems.

We encountered "spotty networks"—unreliable connectivity that would drop randomly, forcing applications to handle disconnection gracefully. Spotty networks weren't a bug; they were a feature of mobile reality.

## AI Ethics Emerges

Around 2003, academics began writing seriously about "AI ethics"—how to build systems that were fair, transparent, and aligned with human values. For mobile operating systems, this meant thinking about privacy, user control, and data protection from the beginning.

Symbian's design incorporated these principles—tight sandboxing, user permission models, encrypted storage. These weren't trendy add-ons; they were essential foundations.

## Core Lessons

- **Prioritize security**: Mobile devices would increasingly carry sensitive data. Security couldn't be an afterthought. It needed to be baked into the kernel.
- **Iterate fast**: With Symbian, we couldn't rely on vendor support or extensive documentation. We had to try, fail quickly, and adjust.
- **Test ruthlessly**: Edge cases on mobile are brutal. A crash that would close one window on a desktop completely freezes a phone.

## The Mobile Future

By 2003, three paths were becoming clear:

1. **Symbian**: Elegant, purpose-built, but proprietary and limited
2. **Windows Mobile**: Familiar but bloated and power-hungry
3. **Linux**: Open source but still rough for mobile

We didn't know it yet, but within 5 years, a fourth option—Android, built on Linux—would emerge and reshape everything.

## Looking Back

The Symbian work was fascinating and frustrating in equal measure. We were building sophisticated systems on incredibly constrained hardware. The "hacks" weren't shortcuts; they were elegant solutions to hard problems. Mobile operating systems would carry billions of people forward into the connected future.
