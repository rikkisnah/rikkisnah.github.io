A poem for my brother. Reflecting on life, family, and the passage of time.

## Too Young to Die

> Once I was four years old, i told my mama
> "Pretty woman walking down the streah haha"
> Then she shouted at me and i said mama
> "You ugly woman, yacking down the stream yah"

> That was then and the world was smaller
> And everything was so simpler and life was gentler
> My brother and I were running down the roads in Sodnac
> Drinking our dad's secret stash of cognac

> My world so full of love with my ma, pa and rik
> I raised my head and smiled because that was no trick
> I knew my daddy will carry me in his arms from my green car
> And Ma will tuck me not so far
> from my Rik

> Then I became eleven years and I went to my daddy's school
> Where I learnt to play a lot truant and lots of pool
> But I always remained no fool

> Then adolescence came and with it a lot conflicting times
> Rik got all study and never spent any time
> with me, Dad got old with the pains of work
> My mama only remained sane to me just as a clockwork
> Of love, dispensing me with loads of it
> It was enough for my sanity

> Then I became 18 years old
> And I flew to a very cold
> Place that was called Paris
> Never I knew she would be my mistress
> for the rest of my life
> She was not meant to be my wife
> This remains a mystery
> Why not, maybe because it was too much of misery

> Then I turned 30 years old
> No longer was I a boy and Paris was no longer cold
> Paris was home, and I was surrounded by many friends
> Fighting all odds and ends,
> I found happiness and success
> In spite of all the mess
> Of what is life

> Then I turned 33, and life ended
> With lots pain and tears were raining
> I could see my ma, pa pouring
> their life to save me.
> But even I could not save me.

> This is my story
> It is not all merry
> But it was surrounded with lots of love
> Each time you see that dove
> In the sky, Think of me
