## The Millennium Bug Looms

As an NTU student in Singapore during the waning days of 1998 and early 1999, I found myself swept up in what would become the defining technical challenge of the era: Y2K debugging. The humid labs of Nanyang Technological University buzzed with anxiety and excitement as midnight on December 31st approached—would systems across the world crash when the calendar rolled from 1999 to 2000?

## The Challenge

In 1999, Y2K debugging was all the rage—or at least in my corner of the tech world. I spent weeks deploying solutions, wrestling with legacy systems that had been storing years as two-digit numbers for decades. The problem seemed simple enough on paper: find every instance where dates were stored or processed, understand the cascade of dependencies, and implement fixes without breaking existing functionality.

The challenges were real. Latency spikes became common as systems groaned under the weight of additional validation logic. Every bug fix introduced the possibility of new ones. We worked late into the humid Singapore nights, fueled by teh tarik from the nearby kopitiam and the determination to prevent a global meltdown.

## The Breakthroughs

But when the fixes worked—when we saw systems correctly handling the millennium transition—it was pure magic. There was something deeply satisfying about staving off what could have been a technological catastrophe. We were problem-solvers, systems architects, detectives hunting through thousands of lines of code.

These experiences taught me principles that still guide my work today:

- **Document everything**: Future developers need to understand not just what you did, but why you did it. Cryptic code comments from 1999 still haunt me.
- **Embrace modularity**: When systems are cleanly separated, bugs don't cascade through the entire stack.
- **Test ruthlessly**: Edge cases matter. The year 2000 was just one edge case that could have brought everything down.

## The Impact

Tying back to my roots—from NTU code jams to OCI racks—this era shaped how I see tech: not as gadgets, but as bridges to possibility. The Y2K challenge taught me that technology exists to serve human needs, and that careful, methodical work can prevent disaster.

What's your take on Y2K debugging today? Do you remember the fears and the fixes?

Looking ahead to the next millennium...
