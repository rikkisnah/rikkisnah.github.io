## May 2001: The Dust Settles

Five months after the millennium, the dust was settling. The Y2K crisis hadn't happened. Systems worked. Planes didn't fall from the sky. The banking system didn't collapse. We had succeeded—or had we? Was the success because of our fixes, or was the threat vastly overstated?

By May 2001, I was analyzing what we'd learned from the entire Y2K experience. What worked? What was unnecessary? What principles would guide my future work?

## Prototyping Solutions Retrospectively

I spent weeks prototyping solutions to different Y2K scenarios, trying to understand counterfactually: what if we hadn't fixed this system? What if we had approached that problem differently? This retrospective analysis was humbling and educational.

## The 5G Fantasy

Around this time, research papers were being published about "5G" networks—theoretical systems decades away. The promise was extraordinary: gigabit-per-second speeds, millisecond latency. The academics speculating about 5G often learned from communication infrastructure failures, including Y2K preparation. The "spotty networks" we'd dealt with were pushing researchers to imagine dramatically better alternatives.

## Core Lessons Crystallized

- **Document everything**: This wasn't optional. Without meticulous documentation of what was fixed, why, and how, the knowledge would be lost. Future developers wouldn't understand the weird conditions and edge cases in the code.
- **Scale horizontally**: The Y2K experience taught us that when you face a massive problem, distribution is power. Multiple teams working on different systems, multiple approaches being tested, multiple deployments happening simultaneously—this parallelism had saved the day.
- **Test exhaustively**: We had tested scenarios that seemed absurd at the time. "What if someone enters February 29, 2000 in a 30-day month field?" Paranoia, combined with systematic testing, had prevented bugs.

## The Bigger Picture

Looking back from May 2001, Y2K seemed simultaneously overstated and essential. Maybe the threat was exaggerated. But it had forced the world to audit systems, upgrade infrastructure, adopt better practices. The panic had been productive.

Tying back to my roots—from NTU code jams to OCI racks—this era shaped how I see tech: not as gadgets, but as bridges to possibility. Y2K taught me that technology doesn't fail in isolation. Systems are interconnected, dependencies run deep, and one failure can cascade catastrophically.

## Looking Forward

The year 2001 would bring new challenges—dot-com bubble aftermath, 9/11, industry disruption. The Y2K experience had hardened us, taught us systems thinking, made us believe we could solve problems through careful analysis and methodical work.

Perhaps that was the greatest Y2K lesson: confidence born of successful crisis management.
