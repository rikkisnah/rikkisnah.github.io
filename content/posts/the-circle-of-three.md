A reflection on the bonds that form the foundation of a life—family, love, and the quiet strength found in togetherness.

## The Circle of Three

> In morning light he stands so still, <br>
> A quiet strength, an iron will.<br>
> Yet when their laughter fills the air, <br>
> His heart forgets all weight and care.

> Rekha, the song that warms his days, <br>
> Her smile, a sun through life's long haze. <br>
> Roy, his echo, bold and free, <br>
> A mirror of what love can be.

> And Estelle, the calm, the flame,<br>
> The home within his heart's own frame.<br>
> Through every storm, her hand in his— <br>
> That's what forever truly is.

> So when the night folds all in peace,<br>
> He whispers thanks that does not cease: <br>
> For love's not spoken, bought, or planned, <br>
> It lives where they together stand.
