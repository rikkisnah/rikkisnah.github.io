I spent three unforgettable weeks in Mauritius during July-August 2025. This trip was special in so many ways - it was about honoring family legacy, building new opportunities, and celebrating the people who matter most.

## 1. Baptism of Laxmi Villa - A Dream Reborn

Estelle and I completed the renovation of Laxmi Villa, the house Dad and Ma built in 1999 after I left Mauritius. The three-floor structure has always held meaning for our family:
- Level 1: Laxmi
- Level 2: Ranjiv
- Level 3: Rikesh

We kept the names as a tribute to the family vision.

Dad had dreamed this would be the house where Ranjiv, my family, Ma, and he would spend their holidays together. But life decided differently. After Ranjiv passed away in 2016, the house was left on its own for years. We decided to keep it alive, to honor that dream in a new way.

The renovation took 2 years, with incredible help from Estelle's Dad - Jose Nicolas. We transformed it into a space the kids really enjoyed - updated to what they know in the USA, with their own space and modern facilities. Soon, we'll be renting it out on Airbnb, but it will always remain a vacation place for us.

Flic en Flac is beautiful and close to our friends from Singapore. This house is more than just property - it's a connection to family, to memories, and to the future.

## 2. Working with Mauritius Government, Oracle, and Telecoms

I spent one week working with the Mauritius Government, Mauritius Oracle, and Mauritius Telecoms. I presented some of the work we're doing at Oracle in AI/LLM infrastructure. It was great networking - I met with CEOs and government ministries.

The hope is to have Oracle invest more in Mauritius and vice-versa - to make Mauritius an AI hub in Southern Africa. It's exciting to think about the potential impact this could have on the island's technology future.

## 3. Dad's 75th Birthday and 47th Wedding Anniversary

We celebrated Dad's 75th birthday and my parents' 47th wedding anniversary. It was a beautiful moment to gather as a family and honor the journey they've been on together.

We also took time to remember Dada and Dad's father - honoring the generations that came before us.

This trip reminded me that life is about keeping dreams alive, even when they transform into something different than originally imagined. Laxmi Villa, the work in Mauritius, and time with family - all of it connects the past, present, and future.
