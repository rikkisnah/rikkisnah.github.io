## Nine Months to Midnight

By March 1999, the reality of Y2K had settled in. We weren't just fixing individual bugs anymore—we were optimizing entire systems to handle the load. The early fixes had been successful, but now came the challenge of scaling: how do you ensure that millions of transactions process correctly when systems are running parallel validation checks?

## The Optimization Journey

As an NTU student, I spent weeks optimizing solutions, shifting from "getting it to work" to "getting it to work efficiently." This meant rethinking our approach from the ground up. Legacy systems that processed dates needed to handle the year 2000 transition without introducing latency that would cripple business operations.

We encountered unexpected challenges. Power constraints in data centers meant cooling was critical. As systems ran harder than they ever had, they consumed more electricity and generated more heat. We had to balance performance gains with physical limitations of the infrastructure.

## Key Lessons in Scaling

Through this process, I learned invaluable lessons:

- **Scale horizontally**: Instead of making single machines more powerful, distribute the workload across multiple systems. This became a fundamental principle I've carried throughout my career.
- **Document everything**: Every optimization decision needed justification. Why did we choose this approach over that one? Future maintainers needed to understand not just the code, but the reasoning.
- **Monitor continuously**: You can't optimize what you don't measure. We built monitoring into every system to track performance in real-time.

## The Wearable Revolution Beckons

Around this same time, early wearable hacks were starting to emerge—simple pagers and early mobile devices. While Y2K consumed most of our attention, we couldn't help but notice that computing was about to change dramatically. The future would be distributed, mobile, always-on.

This realization influenced how we built our Y2K solutions. We weren't just fixing the past; we were building infrastructure that could support the next era of computing.

Looking back, March 1999 was the moment when optimization shifted from a luxury to a necessity.
