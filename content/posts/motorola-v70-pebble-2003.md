## A Rugged Candybar Phone - 2003

Working at Motorola's Design Center in Singapore (Ang Mo Kio), I had the opportunity to work on the **Motorola V70**, codenamed "Pebble" during development. This was one of Motorola's rugged, business-focused candybar phones designed for durability and reliability.

### The Phone

The V70 was positioned as a tough, weatherproof alternative to sleeker models. It featured:
- Ruggedized design built to withstand drops and environmental stress
- Compact candybar form factor
- Focus on durability and long battery life
- Business-oriented feature set

### My Role - Testing, QA & Embedded Systems

At the Design Center in Singapore, my work on the V70 involved:

**Quality Assurance (QA)**
- Extensive testing of hardware durability under stress conditions
- Battery life validation across different usage scenarios
- Display and button reliability testing
- Environmental stress testing (temperature, humidity, vibration)

**Factory Integration**
- Coordinating with manufacturing teams to ensure production quality
- Testing firmware builds across manufacturing batches
- Validating QA processes with production facilities

**Embedded Systems**
- Working with the embedded firmware team on phone reliability
- Stress testing OS and application performance
- Debugging device behavior across different conditions
- Contributing to firmware robustness improvements

### Manufacturing Legacy

The V70 represented Motorola's commitment to durable mobile devices. The testing and QA rigor I worked on in Singapore's Design Center helped establish Motorola's reputation for building phones that could survive real-world conditions.

This experience reinforced the importance of rigorous testing and manufacturing coordination in delivering reliable consumer electronics.
