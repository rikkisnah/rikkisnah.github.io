## Java: The Future of Computing?

In February 2000, just two months after the Y2K celebration, the tech world buzzed with a different promise: write once, run anywhere. Java was going to revolutionize computing. Sun Microsystems was betting big on applets—small Java programs that would run in web browsers, turning the browser into a universal application platform.

As an NTU student in the dorms, I had front-row access to this revolution. Every lab machine had Java installed. Every CS assignment seemed to involve writing applets. The promise was intoxicating: real programming in the browser.

## The Reality Check

Of course, reality was messier. I spent weeks debugging applet issues—compatibility problems between browsers, security restrictions that made applets nearly useless, download times that felt glacial. The "data floods" I faced weren't just network bandwidth; they were floods of ClassNotFoundExceptions, security permission denials, and frustrated users.

## Challenges That Shaped Thinking

- **Test ruthlessly**: Applets behaved differently in different browsers on different machines. We couldn't test in a lab once and assume it would work everywhere. Every combination was a potential failure point.
- **Prioritize security**: Java's sandboxing was ahead of its time—but also frustrating. The restrictions that made Java "safe" also made it nearly impossible to build practical applications.
- **Embrace modularity**: The component-based nature of applets—the idea that you could drop a piece of functionality into a page—was genuinely innovative, even if the execution fell short.

## Early Mobile and the Bridge

Around this time, early mobile phones were getting internet access. We imagined: what if mobile devices ran Java? What if the same code that ran in browsers could run on phones? The dream was compelling, even if the current reality fell short.

## The Dorm Life

Living in the dorms gave us an interesting advantage. We could test applets on machines with varying configurations, network speeds, and installed software. One dormmate would have the latest JVM, another would have an old version. This real-world testing ground revealed problems that pristine lab conditions never would.

The late-night debugging sessions, the teh tarik runs, the collective frustration and occasional breakthroughs—they all happened here, in the dorms, away from official channels.

Looking ahead, Java would find success, but not in browsers. It would become the language of servers, enterprise systems, and eventually the Android ecosystem. The applets we were building would mostly disappear, but the principles we learned—modularity, testing, security—would endure.
