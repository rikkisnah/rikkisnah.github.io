Welcome to my little corner of the web! When I started an earlier version of this blog in 1999 (on older infrastructure), it was for me to share and reinforce what I learned over time. As time evolved, it became a mixture of my career evolution in tech and general life events. I live in Seattle. I speak English, French, Hindi, passable Mandarin and Bahasa Melayu, and Klingon. I have worked most of my career in cloud infrastructure, specializing in HPC and GPU technologies.

## What You'll Find Here

The intent of this blog is for me to share my journey, lessons learned, and articles I find interesting. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the community.

## About My Faith & Family

I am a firm believer that there is a singular God that governs our world, and what we do is to follow His path. I am married to my wonderful wife Estelle and blessed with two amazing kids - Rekha and Roy.

## My Values & Perspective

I consider myself to be middle-conservative with values centered around small government and a fair approach to equity. I believe in the power of individual responsibility, free markets, and limited government intervention, while also recognizing the importance of creating opportunities for all members of society to succeed.
