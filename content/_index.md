Welcome to my little corner of the web! When I started an earlier version of this blog in 1999 (on older infrastructure), it was for me to share and reinforce what I learned over time. As time evolved, it became a mixture of my career evolution in tech and general life events. I live in Seattle. I speak English, French, Hindi, passable Mandarin and Bahasa Melayu, and Klingon. I have worked most of my career in cloud infrastructure, specializing in HPC and GPU technologies.
