      <description>The Millennium Bug Looms As an NTU student in Singapore during the waning days of 1998 and early 1999, I found myself swept up in what would become the defining technical challenge of the era: Y2K debugging. The humid labs of Nanyang Technological University buzzed with anxiety and excitement as midnight on December 31st approached—would systems across the world crash when the calendar rolled from 1999 to 2000?&#xA;In 1999, Y2K debugging was all the rage in my corner of the tech world.</description>

      <description>The Linux Revolution Reaches NTU By September 2001, Linux was transitioning from hobbyist project to legitimate alternative to proprietary Unix systems. NTU, as a forward-thinking institution, started deploying Linux in labs. After years of expensive proprietary systems, here was an free, open operating system that actually worked.&#xA;For students raised on Windows, encountering Linux was revelatory. The source code was available. You could modify it. You could understand how everything worked down to the kernel level.</description>

      <description>Java: The Future of Computing (February 2000) In February 2000, just two months after the Y2K celebration, the tech world buzzed with a different promise: write once, run anywhere. Java was going to revolutionize computing. Sun Microsystems was betting big on applets—small Java programs that would run in web browsers, turning the browser into a universal application platform.&#xA;As an NTU student in the dorms, I had front-row access to this revolution.</description>

      <description>Wireless Revolution Begins (July 1999) By July 1999, Wi-Fi technology was emerging from IEEE 802.11 specifications into practical reality. Singapore, as a forward-thinking tech hub, was one of the first places to experiment with widespread wireless networking. As an NTU student, I had access to some of these early deployments, and the possibilities seemed limitless.&#xA;I spent weeks debugging solutions for wireless connectivity. The early Wi-Fi standards had significant challenges. Signal attenuation was unpredictable.</description>

      <title>Matrix Neural Net Dreams: Reflections from 1999</title>

      <description>The Dream of Artificial Intelligence In May 1999, while the world was preoccupied with the approaching Y2K crisis, I found myself exploring something entirely different in the NTU labs: neural networks. The term &amp;ldquo;neural net dreams&amp;rdquo; might sound whimsical now, but in 1999, this was genuinely visionary work. We were exploring how computers could learn from data, much like the human brain.&#xA;The Technical Challenge Matrix operations are the backbone of neural networks.</description>
