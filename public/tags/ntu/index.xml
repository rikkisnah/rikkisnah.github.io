      <title>Y2K Debugging Journey: From Crisis to Lessons Learned</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-crisis-that-never-was-1999-2000&#34;&gt;The Crisis That Never Was (1999-2000)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summer 1999: The world was panicked. Every computer system would crash at midnight on Dec 31, 1999 because programmers in the 1970s had stored years as 2-digit numbers. 99 rolled to 00, and—disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At NTU, we treated it seriously. Every system we touched had the same problem: years stored as &lt;code&gt;YY&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt;. The fix was mechanical but tedious: find every date field, add validation, test like hell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Early Linux at NTU: Open Source Becomes Real</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-linux-revolution-reaches-ntu&#34;&gt;The Linux Revolution Reaches NTU&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By September 2001, Linux was transitioning from hobbyist project to legitimate alternative to proprietary Unix systems. NTU, as a forward-thinking institution, started deploying Linux in labs. After years of expensive proprietary systems, here was an free, open operating system that actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For students raised on Windows, encountering Linux was revelatory. The source code was available. You could modify it. You could understand how everything worked down to the kernel level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Java Applets Journey: Write Once, Run Anywhere?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/java-applets-journey-2000/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-once-run-anywhere-2000&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Write Once, Run Anywhere&amp;rdquo; (2000)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Java shipped 1995. By 2000, Sun was convinced: Java applets would replace native applications. Download an applet from a website, it runs in your browser on any OS. Windows, Mac, Linux—same code everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At NTU, every CS class assignment involved Java. The promise was seductive. But reality was brutal: applets were slow (multi-MB downloads!), full of security bugs, and incompatible across browsers. Try to download a file? Permission denied. Try to use a system library? ClassNotFoundExceptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi Experiments: From Lab to Campus Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;wireless-networking-1999&#34;&gt;Wireless Networking (1999)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IEEE 802.11 shipped in 1997. By 1999, Singapore was ahead of the curve—early 802.11b trials at universities. At NTU, we had access to experimental wireless infrastructure. The dream: no wires. Just laptops talking over the air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reality: signal was weak, interference constant, range 20 meters on a good day. Tropical humidity killed performance. Water vapor absorbs radio waves. Our tests worked in the lab, then failed in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Matrix Neural Net Dreams: Reflections on Early AI</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;machine-learning-before-it-was-cool-1999&#34;&gt;Machine Learning Before It Was Cool (1999)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While everyone worried about Y2K, I was playing with neural networks at NTU. Not because I thought they&amp;rsquo;d ship in products—they were academic curiosities then. But because the math was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core insight: if you could represent a problem as matrices, you could teach a network to solve it via backpropagation. Weights → matrix multiply → gradient descent → improved weights. Repeat until convergence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
