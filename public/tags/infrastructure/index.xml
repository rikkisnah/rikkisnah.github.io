      <description>Disclaimer: This article reflects my personal research and analysis based on publicly available information and is not representative of my employer&amp;rsquo;s official position.&#xA;In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI infrastructure, one company has quietly revolutionized how we think about GPU computing at scale. Through a series of &amp;ldquo;First Principles&amp;rdquo; engineering blogs and groundbreaking deployments, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) has demonstrated that starting from fundamental physics and systems design—rather than following industry conventions—can yield extraordinary results.</description>

      <description>Three weeks in Batam, Indonesia in March 2025. Not a vacation - something far more meaningful. I was there to help bring the NVIDIA GB200 data plane to life, working alongside some of the brightest minds at OCI and NVIDIA. This was the moment where cutting-edge technology meets real-world infrastructure, and I got to be part of making it happen.&#xA;Related readings:&#xA;Behind the Scenes: NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 on OCI APIs - Technical deep dive on the NVIDIA GB200 and OCI integration Supercluster: NVIDIA Blackwell Dedicated Alloy - OCI&amp;rsquo;s Supercluster offering with Blackwell GPUs Nvidia GB200 NVL72 Now Available via Oracle Cloud - Data Center Dynamics coverage of the launch The Mission: Time to Market When I arrived in Batam, the pressure was real.</description>

      <description>Wireless Networking (1999) IEEE 802.11 shipped in 1997. By 1999, Singapore was ahead of the curve—early 802.11b trials at universities. At NTU, we had access to experimental wireless infrastructure. The dream: no wires. Just laptops talking over the air.&#xA;Reality: signal was weak, interference constant, range 20 meters on a good day. Tropical humidity killed performance. Water vapor absorbs radio waves. Our tests worked in the lab, then failed in the hallway.</description>
