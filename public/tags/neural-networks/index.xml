      <description>Machine Learning Before It Was Cool (1999) While everyone worried about Y2K, I was playing with neural networks at NTU. Not because I thought they&amp;rsquo;d ship in products—they were academic curiosities then. But because the math was beautiful.&#xA;The core insight: if you could represent a problem as matrices, you could teach a network to solve it via backpropagation. Weights → matrix multiply → gradient descent → improved weights. Repeat until convergence.</description>
