      <description>Bluetooth Matures By March 2003, Bluetooth had matured significantly. What was experimental in 2002 was becoming production-ready. We weren&amp;rsquo;t just prototyping anymore; we were building devices that would ship to millions of users.&#xA;Optimizing for Production I spent weeks optimizing Bluetooth solutions for real-world deployment. We were now thinking about data floods—not just from users, but from the Bluetooth ecosystem itself. Multiple devices connecting, interfering with each other, creating cascade effects.</description>

You could leave your headset at your desk and walk around the office with your phone.</description>
