      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-crisis-that-never-was-1999-2000&#34;&gt;The Crisis That Never Was (1999-2000)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summer 1999: The world was panicked. Every computer system would crash at midnight on Dec 31, 1999 because programmers in the 1970s had stored years as 2-digit numbers. 99 rolled to 00, andâ€”disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At NTU, we treated it seriously. Every system we touched had the same problem: years stored as &lt;code&gt;YY&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;YYYY&lt;/code&gt;. The fix was mechanical but tedious: find every date field, add validation, test like hell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-linux-revolution-reaches-ntu&#34;&gt;The Linux Revolution Reaches NTU&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By September 2001, Linux was transitioning from hobbyist project to legitimate alternative to proprietary Unix systems. NTU, as a forward-thinking institution, started deploying Linux in labs. After years of expensive proprietary systems, here was an free, open operating system that actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For students raised on Windows, encountering Linux was revelatory. The source code was available. You could modify it. You could understand how everything worked down to the kernel level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
