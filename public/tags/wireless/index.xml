      <description>The Final Iteration By July 2003, iPod integration had occupied our thoughts for over a year. We&amp;rsquo;d tried multiple approaches, learned painful lessons, and were now implementing what felt like the most promising solution.&#xA;Scaling Wireless Solutions I spent weeks scaling solutions—moving from prototype to something that could work for millions of users. The question shifted: how do you synchronize music to phones wirelessly, reliably, without overwhelming networks?&#xA;We were inspired by emerging &amp;ldquo;wearable hacks&amp;rdquo;—early research into wearable computing devices that might eventually sync with phones.</description>

      <description>Bluetooth Matures By March 2003, Bluetooth had matured significantly. What was experimental in 2002 was becoming production-ready. We weren&amp;rsquo;t just prototyping anymore; we were building devices that would ship to millions of users.&#xA;Optimizing for Production I spent weeks optimizing Bluetooth solutions for real-world deployment. We were now thinking about data floods—not just from users, but from the Bluetooth ecosystem itself. Multiple devices connecting, interfering with each other, creating cascade effects.</description>

      <description>The Bluetooth Promise By August 2002, Bluetooth had been standardized for a few years, but actual working implementations were still rare. The promise was revolutionary: wirelessly connect your phone to headsets, computers, other devices—all without wires, all at close range.&#xA;At Motorola, we saw Bluetooth as the future. Instead of wired connections or limited infrared, devices could communicate wirelessly over a distance of 10 meters. You could leave your headset at your desk and walk around the office with your phone.</description>

      <title>3G Rollout: The Future of Mobile Communication</title>

      <description>Moving to Motorola In 2002, I left academia and joined Motorola Mobile Devices. The timing was perfect. Motorola was at the center of the 3G revolution—the transition from 2G networks (which enabled SMS and basic data) to 3G networks (which promised high-speed data and multimedia).&#xA;The 3G Vision The promise was intoxicating. Imagine a mobile phone that could stream video, enable real-time applications, support navigation and location services. 3G would deliver megabits per second instead of kilobits.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi Scaling: From Lab Experiments to Campus Networks</title>

      <description>From Lab Success to Production By May 2000, our Wi-Fi experiments from 1999 had proven successful enough that NTU was considering a campus-wide deployment. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about adding more access points; it was about understanding how wireless networks could scale from experimental hobby to critical infrastructure.&#xA;The challenge shifted from &amp;ldquo;can we do this?&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;how do we do this reliably for hundreds of users simultaneously?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Scaling Wireless Networks I spent weeks scaling solutions, grappling with the complexities of managing a distributed network of access points.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi Experiments Singapore: Reflections from 1999</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/wifi-experiments-singapore-1999/</link>

      <description>Wireless Revolution Begins By July 1999, Wi-Fi technology was emerging from IEEE 802.11 specifications into practical reality. Singapore, as a forward-thinking tech hub, was one of the first places to experiment with widespread wireless networking. As an NTU student, I had access to some of these early deployments, and the possibilities seemed limitless.&#xA;The Technical Frontier I spent weeks debugging solutions for wireless connectivity. The early Wi-Fi standards had significant challenges.</description>
