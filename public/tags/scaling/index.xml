      <title>Wi-Fi Scaling: From Lab Experiments to Campus Networks</title>

      <description>From Lab Success to Production By May 2000, our Wi-Fi experiments from 1999 had proven successful enough that NTU was considering a campus-wide deployment. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t just about adding more access points; it was about understanding how wireless networks could scale from experimental hobby to critical infrastructure.&#xA;The challenge shifted from &amp;ldquo;can we do this?&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;how do we do this reliably for hundreds of users simultaneously?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Scaling Wireless Networks I spent weeks scaling solutions, grappling with the complexities of managing a distributed network of access points.</description>

      <title>Y2K Optimization: Scaling Solutions in 1999</title>

      <description>Nine Months to Midnight By March 1999, the reality of Y2K had settled in. We weren&amp;rsquo;t just fixing individual bugs anymoreâ€”we were optimizing entire systems to handle the load. The early fixes had been successful, but now came the challenge of scaling: how do you ensure that millions of transactions process correctly when systems are running parallel validation checks?&#xA;The Optimization Journey As an NTU student, I spent weeks optimizing solutions, shifting from &amp;ldquo;getting it to work&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;getting it to work efficiently.</description>
