  <section><h2 id="the-crisis-that-never-was-1999-2000">The Crisis That Never Was (1999-2000)</h2>
<p>Summer 1999: The world was panicked. Every computer system would crash at midnight on Dec 31, 1999 because programmers in the 1970s had stored years as 2-digit numbers. 99 rolled to 00, and—disaster.</p>
<p>At NTU, we treated it seriously. Every system we touched had the same problem: years stored as <code>YY</code> instead of <code>YYYY</code>. The fix was mechanical but tedious: find every date field, add validation, test like hell.</p>
<p>But something odd happened: it wasn&rsquo;t that hard. Not magic, just systematic. Map every date field. Write fixes. Test. Move on.</p>
<p>By December 30, 1999, the panic had faded. We were confident the world wouldn&rsquo;t end. And it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="the-breakthroughs">The Breakthroughs</h2>
<p>When the fixes worked—when we saw systems correctly handling the millennium transition—it was pure magic. There was something deeply satisfying about staving off what could have been a technological catastrophe. We were problem-solvers, systems architects, detectives hunting through thousands of lines of code.</p>
<h2 id="scaling-solutions-march-1999">Scaling Solutions (March 1999)</h2>
<p>By March 1999, the reality of Y2K had settled in. We weren&rsquo;t just fixing individual bugs anymore—we were optimizing entire systems to handle the load. The early fixes had been successful, but now came the challenge of scaling: how do you ensure that millions of transactions process correctly when systems are running parallel validation checks?</p>
<p>I spent weeks optimizing solutions, shifting from &ldquo;getting it to work&rdquo; to &ldquo;getting it to work efficiently.&rdquo; This meant rethinking our approach from the ground up. Legacy systems that processed dates needed to handle the year 2000 transition without introducing latency that would cripple business operations.</p>
<p>We encountered unexpected challenges. Power constraints in data centers meant cooling was critical. As systems ran harder than they ever had, they consumed more electricity and generated more heat. We had to balance performance gains with physical limitations of the infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="key-lessons-in-scaling">Key Lessons in Scaling</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale horizontally</strong>: Instead of making single machines more powerful, distribute the workload across multiple systems. This became a fundamental principle I&rsquo;ve carried throughout my career.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor continuously</strong>: You can&rsquo;t optimize what you don&rsquo;t measure. We built monitoring into every system to track performance in real-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Around this same time, early wearable hacks were starting to emerge—simple pagers and early mobile devices. While Y2K consumed most of our attention, we couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that computing was about to change dramatically. The future would be distributed, mobile, always-on.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-sprint-september-1999">The Final Sprint (September 1999)</h2>
<p>September 28, 1999. Just 94 days until January 1, 2000. The reality of Y2K was no longer abstract—it was imminent. In the NTU labs, we had shifted from &ldquo;let&rsquo;s fix this&rdquo; to &ldquo;we must fix this NOW.&rdquo; The atmosphere was urgent but focused.</p>
<p>By September, we were debugging solutions at a frantic pace. Every day brought discoveries of systems we hadn&rsquo;t yet examined. Banks were reaching out. Government agencies were escalating. Companies worldwide were panicking, and our solutions were part of the answer.</p>
<p>Latency spikes became a constant concern. When you&rsquo;re adding validation logic to millions of transactions, system performance degrades. Every millisecond mattered. A one-second delay per transaction meant millions of dollars in lost throughput. We optimized obsessively.</p>
<h3 id="the-spectre-of-cloud-bursts">The Spectre of Cloud Bursts</h3>
<p>Imagine if all systems tried to process the date change simultaneously. The &ldquo;cloud burst&rdquo; of activity on January 1st could overwhelm infrastructure. We designed systems to handle this gracefully—queuing, load balancing, overflow management. It was distributed systems thinking before we had modern cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>I spent these final months living and breathing Y2K. Sleep was a luxury. Teh tarik runs became more frequent. The humidity seemed more oppressive. Every bug fixed revealed five more to fix. Every test uncovered edge cases we hadn&rsquo;t considered.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-in-high-pressure-delivery">Lessons in High-Pressure Delivery</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iterate fast</strong>: We couldn&rsquo;t afford lengthy approval processes. We needed to identify issues, fix them, test them, and deploy them quickly. Speed without recklessness.</li>
<li><strong>Communicate constantly</strong>: As the deadline approached, stakeholder anxiety grew. Regular updates—even when we had to report bad news—kept everyone informed and aligned.</li>
</ul>
<p>As September ended and October began, we had fixed the critical issues, but uncertainty remained. Would everything work when the clock struck midnight?</p>
<h2 id="the-aftermath-and-what-we-learned-may-2001">The Aftermath and What We Learned (May 2001)</h2>
<p>Five months after the millennium, the dust was settling. The Y2K crisis hadn&rsquo;t happened. Systems worked. Planes didn&rsquo;t fall from the sky. The banking system didn&rsquo;t collapse. We had succeeded—or had we? Was the success because of our fixes, or was the threat vastly overstated?</p>
<p>By May 2001, I was analyzing what we&rsquo;d learned from the entire Y2K experience. What worked? What was unnecessary? What principles would guide my future work?</p>
<p>I spent weeks prototyping solutions to different Y2K scenarios, trying to understand counterfactually: what if we hadn&rsquo;t fixed this system? What if we had approached that problem differently? This retrospective analysis was humbling and educational.</p>
<h3 id="the-5g-fantasy-emerges">The 5G Fantasy Emerges</h3>
<p>Around this time, research papers were being published about &ldquo;5G&rdquo; networks—theoretical systems decades away. The promise was extraordinary: gigabit-per-second speeds, millisecond latency. The academics speculating about 5G often learned from communication infrastructure failures, including Y2K preparation. The &ldquo;spotty networks&rdquo; we&rsquo;d dealt with were pushing researchers to imagine dramatically better alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="core-principles-that-endured">Core Principles That Endured</h2>
<p>Across the entire Y2K journey from 1999 to 2001, several principles became clear and have guided my career:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Document everything</strong>: Future developers need to understand not just what you did, but why you did it. Cryptic code comments from 1999 still haunt me. This wasn&rsquo;t optional. Without meticulous documentation of what was fixed, why, and how, the knowledge would be lost.</li>
<li><strong>Embrace modularity</strong>: When systems are cleanly separated, bugs don&rsquo;t cascade through the entire stack.</li>
<li><strong>Test ruthlessly</strong>: Edge cases matter. The year 2000 was just one edge case that could have brought everything down. We tested scenarios that seemed absurd at the time. &ldquo;What if someone enters February 29, 2000 in a 30-day month field?&rdquo; Paranoia, combined with systematic testing, had prevented bugs.</li>
<li><strong>Scale horizontally</strong>: The Y2K experience taught us that when you face a massive problem, distribution is power. Multiple teams working on different systems, multiple approaches being tested, multiple deployments happening simultaneously—this parallelism had saved the day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>Looking back from May 2001, Y2K seemed simultaneously overstated and essential. Maybe the threat was exaggerated. But it had forced the world to audit systems, upgrade infrastructure, adopt better practices. The panic had been productive. Y2K taught me that technology doesn&rsquo;t fail in isolation. Systems are interconnected, dependencies run deep, and one failure can cascade catastrophically.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2>
<p>The year 2001 would bring new challenges—dot-com bubble aftermath, 9/11, industry disruption. The Y2K experience had hardened us, taught us systems thinking, made us believe we could solve problems through careful analysis and methodical work.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was the greatest Y2K lesson: confidence born of successful crisis management. The principles we learned—modularity, documentation, horizontal scaling, exhaustive testing—would guide innovations for decades to come.</p>
