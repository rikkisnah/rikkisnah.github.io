      <description>A reflection on the bonds that form the foundation of a life—family, love, and the quiet strength found in togetherness.&#xA;The Circle of Three In morning light he stands so still, A quiet strength, an iron will.&#xA;Yet when their laughter fills the air, His heart forgets all weight and care.&#xA;Rekha, the song that warms his days, Her smile, a sun through life&amp;rsquo;s long haze. Roy, his echo, bold and free, A mirror of what love can be.</description>

      <title>The Great Load Balancer Migration: Managing Three Generations</title>

      <description>By mid-2018, AWS had three load balancers: CLB (2009), ALB (2016), NLB (2017). Millions of customers ran each type in production. The question: how do you migrate without breaking live applications?&#xA;The Problem CLB users: &amp;ldquo;ALB looks nice but our app works fine.&amp;rdquo; ALB users: &amp;ldquo;NLB&amp;rsquo;s latency is seductive but we don&amp;rsquo;t need it.&amp;rdquo; Enterprise IT: &amp;ldquo;Three load balancers? Pick one.&amp;rdquo; Migrations were hard because each load balancer had different routing semantics:</description>

      <title>Network Load Balancer: Extreme Performance for the Cloud</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/aws-nlb-launch-2017/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/aws-nlb-launch-2017/</guid>
      <description>ALB solved microservices routing. NLB solved an entirely different problem: what if you need 20M requests per second at 10 microseconds of latency?&#xA;Answer: don&amp;rsquo;t use ALB. ALB&amp;rsquo;s Layer 7 inspection has overhead. NLB dropped back to Layer 4 and optimized for raw speed.&#xA;The Market Gap By 2017, certain workloads were impossible on AWS:&#xA;High-frequency trading: Microsecond latencies matter (literally worth $1M per millisecond) Gaming: 50M concurrent sessions, sub-100ms latency required DNS: Billions of queries/day, must be answered in &amp;lt;50ms Video streaming: Millions of concurrent UDP streams These needed a load balancer that didn&amp;rsquo;t inspect application data—just hashed flows and forwarded packets fast.</description>

      <description>Classic Load Balancer shipped in 2009 and became a tech debt monster by 2016: 3 microservices = 3 load balancers = $150/month just for routing.&#xA;ALB fixed this with Layer 7 intelligence: one load balancer could route traffic based on paths, hostnames, and HTTP headers.&#xA;The Problem CLB worked fine for one big app per load balancer. But by 2016, everything was microservices:&#xA;GET /api/users → User Service (port 3000) GET /api/products → Product Service (port 3001) GET /images/* → Image Cache (port 8080) GET /* → Web Frontend (port 3000) With CLB, you needed 4 separate load balancers (one per service).</description>

      <description>WorkSpaces Application Manager solved the problem we couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve with GA: how to manage Microsoft Office updates across 1M+ workspaces without downtime.&#xA;The Problem Every Enterprise Customer Hit After a year of WorkSpaces deployments, customers had thousands of workspaces. Then:&#xA;Scenario: Microsoft Office patch Tuesday&#xA;Old way:&#xA;Download Office update Test on isolated machine (1 day) Rebuild golden image with new Office (4 hours) Terminate 5,000 workspaces Reprovision from new image (overnight) Users lose all desktop customizations 😡 Users lost a full day of productivity every month.</description>

      <description>WorkSpaces went GA when we nailed the three things enterprises absolutely required: Active Directory integration, local printing, and compliance frameworks (HIPAA/PCI).&#xA;From Preview to Production 6 months of pilot feedback told us exactly what was missing:&#xA;Active Directory Integration: Enterprises didn&amp;rsquo;t want to manage separate user directories. After GA, WorkSpaces synced seamlessly with on-premises AD via AWS Directory Service. Users logged in with their corp creds; IT enforced group policies across desktops.</description>

      <description>Mayday Button + 339ppi display + Snapdragon S4 = Fire HD customers willing to spend $50–100 more for a tablet that actually felt premium.&#xA;The Problem with Fire HD v1 Fire HD was cheap, but it felt cheap. Sluggish scrolling in Kindle. Games stuttered. The 7-inch screen had visible pixels. And when users hit problems? They called customer service, waited on hold, and gave up.&#xA;HDX solved all three: better hardware, prettier screen, and a live person via video within 10 seconds.</description>

Period. That friction, stacked across millions of commuters and travelers, represented the biggest gap between e-readers and physical books. Amazon had shipped 3+ generations of Kindles; every survey said the same thing: light.&#xA;How We Built It Traditional backlit screens bleed light unevenly and drain batteries.</description>

      <description>Wireless Phones (2002) Bluetooth standard existed since 1998. By 2002, nobody had actually shipped it in a phone. At Motorola, we saw the real opportunity: wireless headphones. No more headset cords tangled in your pocket.&#xA;But standards look clean on paper. In reality? Manufacturers interpreted the spec differently. Pairing was flaky. Range was spotty. We spent months debugging why Bluetooth worked 70% of the time instead of 100%.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;d get two devices talking, then change something in our protocol stack, and suddenly they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Moving to Motorola In 2002, I left academia and joined Motorola Mobile Devices. The timing was perfect. Motorola was at the center of the 3G revolution—the transition from 2G networks (which enabled SMS and basic data) to 3G networks (which promised high-speed data and multimedia).&#xA;The 3G Vision The promise was intoxicating. Imagine a mobile phone that could stream video, enable real-time applications, support navigation and location services. 3G would deliver megabits per second instead of kilobits.</description>

      <description>The Crisis That Never Was (1999-2000) Summer 1999: The world was panicked. Every computer system would crash at midnight on Dec 31, 1999 because programmers in the 1970s had stored years as 2-digit numbers. 99 rolled to 00, and—disaster.&#xA;At NTU, we treated it seriously. Every system we touched had the same problem: years stored as YY instead of YYYY. The fix was mechanical but tedious: find every date field, add validation, test like hell.</description>

      <description>The Linux Revolution Reaches NTU By September 2001, Linux was transitioning from hobbyist project to legitimate alternative to proprietary Unix systems. NTU, as a forward-thinking institution, started deploying Linux in labs. After years of expensive proprietary systems, here was an free, open operating system that actually worked.&#xA;For students raised on Windows, encountering Linux was revelatory. The source code was available. You could modify it. You could understand how everything worked down to the kernel level.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Write Once, Run Anywhere&amp;rdquo; (2000) Java shipped 1995. By 2000, Sun was convinced: Java applets would replace native applications. Download an applet from a website, it runs in your browser on any OS. Windows, Mac, Linux—same code everywhere.&#xA;At NTU, every CS class assignment involved Java. The promise was seductive. But reality was brutal: applets were slow (multi-MB downloads!), full of security bugs, and incompatible across browsers. Try to download a file?</description>

At NTU, we had access to experimental wireless infrastructure. The dream: no wires. Just laptops talking over the air.&#xA;Reality: signal was weak, interference constant, range 20 meters on a good day. Tropical humidity killed performance. Water vapor absorbs radio waves.

But because the math was beautiful.&#xA;The core insight: if you could represent a problem as matrices, you could teach a network to solve it via backpropagation. Weights → matrix multiply → gradient descent → improved weights. Repeat until convergence.</description>
