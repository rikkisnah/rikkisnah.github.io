</ul>
<h2 id="the-mission-time-to-market">The Mission: Time to Market</h2>
<p>When I arrived in Batam, the pressure was real. GB200 was new. NVIDIA&rsquo;s latest breakthrough in GPU technology. OCI was committed to being first to market with it. And the data plane - the critical infrastructure layer that handles every packet, every connection, every byte moving through these machines - needed to be battle-ready.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t about perfection on day one. It was about <strong>learning, shipping, and adapting</strong>. Three weeks to validate, test, troubleshoot, and deploy infrastructure that would handle the most demanding workloads in Asia-Pacific.</p>
<h2 id="the-reality-of-new-technology">The Reality of New Technology</h2>
<p>Working with GB200 felt like frontier work. The technology was cutting-edge, but that meant we were often in uncharted territory:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Documentation was incomplete</strong> - We were sometimes writing the playbook as we went</li>
<li><strong>Edge cases appeared constantly</strong> - New hardware reveals new problems</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration was critical</strong> - Every issue required bringing NVIDIA engineers, OCI architects, and our data plane team together</li>
<li><strong>Real-time problem-solving</strong> - We couldn&rsquo;t wait for release cycles; we needed answers in hours</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s something electric about that kind of work. You&rsquo;re not maintaining a system; you&rsquo;re building it. You&rsquo;re not following a checklist; you&rsquo;re writing the checklist.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-plane-perspective">The Data Plane Perspective</h2>
<p>My focus was on the data plane - the networking and compute substrate that sits between the hardware and the applications. This is where microseconds matter. This is where efficiency directly translates to customer performance and cost.</p>
<p>We faced questions that only real deployment could answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does GB200&rsquo;s architecture affect packet flow and latency?</li>
<li>Where are the bottlenecks in our current stack?</li>
<li>What optimizations unlock the performance these GPUs promise?</li>
<li>How do we scale this reliably across multiple machines?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each day brought new insights. Some came from elegant solutions. Others came from failures that taught us more than successes ever could.</p>

<em>The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 - 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs in a single liquid-cooled rack</em></p>
<h2 id="working-with-the-best">Working with the Best</h2>
<p>The team in Batam represented the pinnacle of expertise. NVIDIA engineers who designed the architecture we were deploying. OCI architects with years of experience running hyperscale infrastructure. Each person brought a deep specialization, but the magic happened when those specializations intersected.</p>
<p>Conversations that started with &ldquo;Why is this latency spike happening?&rdquo; would pull in network engineers, GPU specialists, and systems architects. Within hours, we&rsquo;d have root cause analysis and be testing fixes. The knowledge transfer was constant - I learned as much from watching others problem-solve as I did from solving problems myself.</p>
<h2 id="three-weeks-that-mattered">Three Weeks That Mattered</h2>
<p>By the end of three weeks, we had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validated the data plane against real workloads</li>
<li>Identified and fixed critical bottlenecks</li>
<li>Established monitoring and alerting that would catch future issues</li>
<li>Built confidence that this infrastructure was ready for customers</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every deployment challenge was solved, but we had momentum. We had patterns. And we had a team that understood the system deeply enough to adapt when new problems emerged.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/gb200-batam-data-plane-rollout/oci_supercluster.png" alt="OCI Supercluster with NVIDIA Blackwell">
<em>OCI&rsquo;s state-of-the-art infrastructure combining NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking with GB200 systems</em></p>
<h2 id="the-lesson">The Lesson</h2>
<p>This experience reinforced something I&rsquo;ve learned throughout my career: <strong>breakthrough infrastructure comes from diverse expertise executing under pressure with clear purpose</strong>. We weren&rsquo;t perfect. But we were focused. We learned fast. We shipped.</p>
<p>Batam became more than just a data center location for me - it became a reminder that real technology work means getting into the details, working with exceptional people, and being willing to learn something new every single day.</p>
<p>The GB200 is now deployed in OCI&rsquo;s Batam region. Every deployment, every AI workload, every inference that runs there benefits from the three weeks we invested in getting the data plane right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s infrastructure that matters.</p>
